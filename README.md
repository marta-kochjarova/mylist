# MyList - A simple to-do app

I made this simple to-do app that allows users to create and manage their own to-do lists and to-do items. Users can add, edit, delete these lists and items and they can mark to-do tasks as complete or incomplete.
This app is also optimized for mobile devices and allows users to use it in dark mode or a light mode, according to their preferences.
The design of the app is custom-made by me.

## This app uses following stack:
- React.js
- Context
- React hooks
- Typescript
- Axios API calls
- React Bootstrap 5
- SCSS

## To install project dependencies use command:
### `npm i`

## To run the app use command:
### `npm run start`

## Versions:
- Node: v16.14.0
- npm: v9.1.2
